Additions:
  What happens if two (or more) players have the same hand?

	Straight/Straight Flush: The player with the highest card in his straight wins.
	
	Four of a Kind: Player with highest Four of a kind wins, if the same: highest other card

	Flush: highest card in Flush (if the same: 2nd, 3rd,...)

	Full House: first highest Three of a Kind, then highest pair

	Two Pair: First higher pair, then lower pair

	Pair: higher pair, then highest other card,...

	High Card: Highest card, 2nd highest,...

  The suits have no influence on the "value" of your hand
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Roles:
	Dealer: 	The Dealer hands out the cards (here it is just a role), after each round
			the role is shifted one to the left.

	Small Blind:	The player on the left to the dealer has to pay the small blind.

	Big Blind:	The player on the left to the small Blind has to pay the big Blind.

Game:	
	At the end of the round every Player has two pocket Cards, that only the Player can see,
	and there are five community cards on the table, that every Player can see.
	
	To build your hand you use up to 4 of the community cards and at least 1 of your pocket cards.
	Using only community cards wouldn't make sense, since all players have that hand.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Round:
	Preflop:
		First the two pocket cards are dealt and there is a round of betting.
	The Flop:
		(The top card on the stack is thrown away), Three community cards are dealt, round of betting
	The Turn:
		(The top card on the stack is thrown away), one community card is dealt, round of betting
	The River:
		(The top card on the stack is thrown away), the last community card is dealt, round of betting
	The Showdown:
		The pocket cards are revealed and the winner takes the pot
	
Round of betting:
	In the Preflop betting round, the first player to act is left of the big blind, then this role is always shifted one to the left
	
	A Player has the following options:
	 - Fold: don't pay into the pot and toss away your cards, wait for next round
	 - Call/Check: match the amount of the bet/ don't raise
	 - Raise: Raise the amount of the bet
	 - (Begin of Preflop: bet = big blind)

	The round of betting continues until the following conditions are met:
	 - all players had a chance to act
	 - all players that haven't folded have the same amount of money in the pot
